# A simple TODO list that anybody can do
1. Make the house cards look better on mobile. Currently text gets cut off and the card doesn't grow.
2. Possibly remove some of the padding on the house cards.
3. Make 2 versions of the house cards... One large version with more details (for s and > l) and one small version with fewer details (for xs and m)
4. Have the large screen navbar show the current location (Or maybe not, I'm not a design expert)
5. Fill in `About` and `Contact Us`
6. Create issues in git for these things.
